    <h1>Alien: Romulus is a 2024 American science fiction horror film directed by Fede Álvarez, who co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. Produced by Scott Free Productions and Brandywine Productions, it is the ninth installment in the Alien franchise, set between the events of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986). The film stars Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Spike Fearn, and Aileen Wu. It follows a group of downtrodden young space colonists in pursuit of better life conditions, who encounter hostile creatures while scavenging a derelict space station.
   
At CinemaCon in April 2019, 20th Century Fox announced their plans to produce future Alien films. Álvarez was attached as director in March 2022, and Spaeny joined the film as the lead later that year. Filming took place from March to July 2023. Alien: Romulus premiered in Los Angeles on August 12, 2024, and was theatrically released in the United States by 20th Century Studios on August 16. It received positive reviews from critics and has grossed $225.2 million worldwide   </h1>
